{"name":"Gript","tagline":"ZSH Wrapper for Executing Groovy Functions and Aliases","body":"gript\r\n=====\r\n\r\nA ZSH Wrapper for adding custom aliases and functions written in the Groovy programming language. The aliases and functions can be\r\ndirectly called via the command-line.\r\n\r\n**CURRENTLY UNDER HEAVY DEVELOPMENT!**\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n----\r\n\r\nClone this repository into\r\n\r\n* .oh-my-zshell/plugins or\r\n* .zsh/ or\r\n* ~/\r\n\r\nIf you do not use oh-my-zhell you need to make sure to source *gript.plugin.zsh* in your startup ZSH script.\r\n\r\nAlias Configuration\r\n----\r\n\r\nOnce installed, you can modify *gript-aliases.groovy* to add/remove aliases. This file is a Groovy file with an *arguments*\r\nvariable to be used for accessing the command arguments (starting at 0 for the first argument).\r\n\r\nGript scripts are executed with the following pre-defined variables and functions:\r\n\r\n* *GRIPT_HOME* refers to the Gript installation directory\r\n* *WORKING_DIRECTORY* refers to the current working directory from which the alias or function was called\r\n* *griptHome(String fileName)* used to lookup files in the installation directory\r\n* *workingDirecory(String fileName)* used to lookup files in the working directory\r\n\r\n```groovy\r\ngri=\"gradle install\"\r\ngrci=\"gradle clean install\"\r\ngrt=\"gradle test\"\r\ngrt_sub=\"gradle :${arguments[0]}:test\"\r\ngrc=\"gradle clean\"\r\ngrts_sub=\"gradle -Dsingle.test=${arguments[0]} :${arguments[1]}:test\" \r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice, this is a regular Groovy file, we could use more complicated Groovy code if necessary.\r\n\r\nFunction Configuration\r\n----\r\n\r\nYou can modify *gript-functions.groovy* to add/remove functions to be available on the command-line.\r\n\r\n```groovy\r\nunzipGroovy = { args ->\r\n    def proc = \"autojump groovy-core\".execute()\r\n    proc.waitFor()\r\n\r\n    def groovyDirectory = new File(proc.text)\r\n    println \"Groovy installation directory: $groovyDirectory\"\r\n\r\n    def dist = new File(\"${groovyDirectory.absolutePath}/target/distributions/\")\r\n    println \"Dist directory: $dist\"\r\n\r\n    def zip  = new File(dist, \"groovy-binary-2.2.0-SNAPSHOT.zip\")\r\n    if (!zip) return\r\n\r\n    zip.unzip(dist)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease note, the example above shows Gript coming with <a href=\"http://github.com/timyates/groovy-common-extensions\">Groovy common extensions</a> enabled by default.\r\n\r\nExecution\r\n----\r\n\r\nOnce an alias is configured, it can be executed via the given alias on the command-line:\r\n\r\n```\r\n➜  ~  gri\r\n########## running command: gradle install\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n➜  ~  grt_sub library-core\r\n########## running command: gradle :library-core:test\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf functions are configured, you can call them by funcion name (including optional arguments) on the command-line:\r\n\r\n```\r\n➜  ~  unzipGroovy\r\n########## running command: unzipGroovy\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nGript is licensed under a BSD license:\r\n\r\n> Copyright (c) 2013, Andre Steingress\r\n> \r\n> All rights reserved.\r\n> \r\n> Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that\r\n> the following conditions are met:\r\n> \r\n> Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions\r\n> and the following disclaimer.\r\n> Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this list of conditions\r\n> and the following disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\r\n>\r\n> THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED\r\n> WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A\r\n> PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.
